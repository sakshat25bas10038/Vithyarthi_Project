# Global Earthquake-Tsunami Risk Probability Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements a foundational Machine Learning system designed to assess the potential risk of an earthquake generating a destructive tsunami. It performs Binary Classification using key seismic features to predict the Tsunami Indicator (tsunami: 1 for Tsunami, 0 for No Tsunami). The entire workflow is executed within a single Google Colab environment, with the model trained directly on the uploaded data using Logistic Regression.
